GRASS Markdown to Man Page Fix
This project provides a custom Python script that converts GRASS GIS documentation (Markdown files) into properly formatted man pages.
The work focused on fixing issues where:
Markdown leftovers (headings, formatting, links) were still visible in the output.
Autogenerated headers were missing.
The wrong source files were being used (needed to pull from compiled docs in ./dist.x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/docs/mkdocs/source).
The updated script ensures clean conversion so that GRASS GIS docs can be compiled into usable man pages.
Features
Converts .md documentation into man pages.
Cleans up unwanted Markdown formatting.
Works with compiled GRASS docs to include proper headers.
Can be adapted for other GRASS modules if required.
Requirements
Python 3.7+
A compiled version of GRASS GIS (to access processed docs in mkdocs/source).
Usage
Compile GRASS so the docs are generated under:
./dist.x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/docs/mkdocs/source
Place the script in your working directory.
Run the script with the Markdown file as input:
python script.py i.atcorr.md
The output will be a clean .man file.
Example
Input: i.atcorr.md (raw Markdown with formatting leftovers).
Output: i.atcorr.man (properly formatted man page).
Notes
This script was written as a custom solution for a GRASS GIS documentation task.
No commits or pull requests are included here; this repo only contains the script for reference.
The script produces man page files with a `.1` extension (e.g., `i.atcorr.1`).  
This follows the standard Unix convention for general command man pages.
