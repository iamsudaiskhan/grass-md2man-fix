GRASS Markdown to Man Page Fix

## Overview

This project provides a custom Python script that converts GRASS GIS documentation (Markdown files) into properly formatted man pages. The script addresses issues where:

- Markdown leftovers (headings, formatting, links) were visible in output
- Autogenerated headers were missing  
- Wrong source files were being used

The updated script ensures clean conversion so GRASS GIS docs compile into usable man pages.

## Features

- Converts `.md` documentation into man pages
- Cleans up unwanted Markdown formatting
- Works with compiled GRASS docs to include proper headers
- Adaptable for other GRASS modules

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Compiled GRASS GIS (to access processed docs in `mkdocs/source`)

## Usage

1. Compile GRASS to generate docs under:  
   `./dist.x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/docs/mkdocs/source`

2. Place the script in your working directory

3. Run the script with the Markdown file as input:
   ```bash
   python script.py i.atcorr.md
   ```

4. Output will be a clean `.man` file

## Example

- **Input**: `i.atcorr.md` (raw Markdown with formatting leftovers)
- **Output**: `i.atcorr.man` (properly formatted man page)

## Notes

- This is a custom solution for GRASS GIS documentation tasks
- Script produces man page files with `.1` extension (e.g., `i.atcorr.1`)
- Follows standard Unix convention for general command man pages
```
