# grass-md2man-fix
Custom Python script to convert GRASS GIS Markdown documentation into proper man pages. Fixed issues with missing autogenerated headers, leftover Markdown syntax, and incorrect source file usage by compiling GRASS and working with the processed docs in ./dist.x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/docs/mkdocs/source.
